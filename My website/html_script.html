            <p class="intro">
                
                I am a half english, half polish student at Akademeia High school in Warsaw, where I study Computer science, mathematics, physics and Polish for my A-levels.<br>
                The subject I find the greatest interest and passion is computer science, I think it is very important to understand how all the technology around us works.<br>
                Due to my love for computer science I would like to study it at university,
                my ambition is to study at the university of Oxford as I think this would provide the most
                amazing experience and opportunities.
